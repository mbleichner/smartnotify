Make sure that cmake and kdelibs5-dev are installed on your system.
Then execute the following commands:

  mkdir build; cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
  make
  sudo make install


Notify KDE of the newly installed plasmoids:

  kbuildsycoca4


Now you can add them to your desktop and have a lot of fun!
